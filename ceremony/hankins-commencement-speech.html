<h3 style="text-align: center">Commencement Remarks Transcript</h3>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Steve Hankins ’85 is President of the Alumnae/i Association of Vassar College, and joined the Board of Trustees in July 2017. He served as a trustee previously from 1995–2007.</em></p>


<p>To the members of the great Class of 2020 and on behalf of the 40,000 alums that span the globe for Vassar College, I’m here to say congratulations, you did it! What a huge sense of accomplishment each of you should feel receiving a Vassar diploma.</p>
<p>You know, when I was getting ready for these remarks, I was thinking about my Vassar days and I remember getting two very powerful but simple messages from Vassar College. First from the Admissions Office in 1981 telling me, “You are in!” Then, when I graduated, receiving my diploma and being told, “You did it!”</p>
<p>You know, interestingly, from the Alumnae/i Association’s perspective I guess we have both messages, a hardy congratulations at the achievements that that diploma represents—“You did it”—and also “You’re in” because from the Alumnae/i Association’s perspective, as of today, each of you becomes a member of the association. And just as your Vassar diploma is the product of hard work, friends, professors, teachers, family members, classmates, teammates, coaches, so too will your successes after Vassar be linked to a community.</p>
<p>For me it was a community of Vassar alums. The first job I got out of Vassar was from a Vassar friend. The idea to go to law school came from a Vassar friend who is still a friend today. So, I’m here to commit to you that the Alumnae/i Association, all 40,000 of us and all our resources, will be there for you anytime you need it. Please use VassarNet, use LinkedIn, use other social media. Do the old-fashioned route and have coffee with a Vassar alum or call one of us for ideas or help. We are here for you and the Association is here for you, but it only works if you work it.</p>
<p>So, we look forward to hearing from you. We are going to watch you as you go from here, as you achieve great things, as you have successes, as you have failures. We know that some of you will invent great things or win great awards and we look forward to staying in touch. I’ll see you at Reunion, if not before.</p>
	
<p>And again, on behalf of all 40,000 Vassar alums, be proud. Congratulations, you did it and you are in.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
