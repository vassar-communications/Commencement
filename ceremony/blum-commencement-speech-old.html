<p style="text-align: center"><em>Jason Blum is a three-time Academy Award nominee, two-time Emmy Award-winning producer and Vassar trustee and Commencement Speaker.</em></p>

<p>Hello Graduates. <br>
Parents. <br>
Faculty. <br>
Trustees, <br>
President Bradley, <br>
Family <br>
and Friends.<br>
 <br>
I’m sorry <br>
you guys will never be able<br>
to experience<br>
a real life<br>
in person<br>
graduation. <br>
But <br>
take it from me. <br>
Unless you really <br>
hated <br>
college <br>
and couldn’t wait<br>
a second more<br>
to get out,<br>
graduation day<br>
is <br>
terrible. <br>
It’s you <br>
with your divorced parents <br>
having to be together. <br>
It’s trying <br>
very hard <br>
not to act hung over <br>
with your grandparents. <br>
It’s sweaty. <br>
Its sad. <br>
And it usually ends <br>
driving <br>
all your belongings <br>
in a U-Haul <br>
into the abyss. <br>
 <br>
But I get<br>
it is a huge <br>
bummer <br>
that you missed <br>
the better part <br>
of your senior spring semester. <br>
I really <br>
get it—that sucks.<br>
In fact, <br>
I made my first movie <br>
about that. <br>
It was written <br>
and directed <br>
by my Vassar roommate, <br>
Noah Baumbach <br>
and it was called, <br>
at least for a while, <br>
<em>Fifth Year</em>—eventually it was called <em>Kicking and Screaming</em>—anyway<br>
it was about <br>
four guys <br>
who love college <br>
so much <br>
they make up reasons <br>
to stay <br>
an extra year. <br>
 <br>
So I get it. <br>
But don’t fret too much <br>
about missing <br>
this in-person ceremony. <br>
 <br>
Anyway, who the hell am I?<br>
I’m Jason Blum.<br>
I graduated from Vassar in 1991. Yes!<br>
I run a company in Hollywood <br>
called Blumhouse. <br>
We make all kinds of movies, <br>
TV shows, and documentaries.<br>
 We did <em>Whiplash</em> <br>
and <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>,<br />
we have a doc we just released called <em>Secret Love</em> on Netflix. <br>
 <br>
But the company <br>
was built on <br>
and is still known for <br>
scary movies. <br>
Movies like <em>The Purge</em>, <br>
<em>Paranormal Activity</em>, <br>
<em>Get Out</em> and <em>The Invisible Man</em> <br>
 <br>
And I am here <br>
for <br>
a very simple reason. <br>
The world out there<br>
 looks very much <br>
like one of my horror movies, <br>
so who better <br>
to help you navigate it? <br>
Today, <br>
I am going to share with you <br>
the lessons you need <br>
to survive and thrive <br>
in a horror movie, <br>
or in this case, <br>
—the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #1 - <br>
Be true to who you are</strong></p>

<p>From a young age <br>
I was blessed <br>
and cursed <br>
with being extremely <br>
competitive. <br>
Cursed, <br>
because I was not very good <br>
at schoolwork. <br>
I had street smarts <br>
but my book smarts <br>
(and grades) <br>
were just OK. <br>
This left me full of anxiety. <br>
Immediately after I graduated, <br>
I was in a terrible rush to succeed. <br>
Remember <br>
this was before the age <br>
of the Internet entrepreneur. <br>
When I graduated, <br>
Mark Zuckerberg <br>
was seven years old. <br>
When I <br>
was 20, <br>
the only other people <br>
who were my age <br>
and really successful <br>
were famous actors.  <br>
 <br>
So that’s what I wanted to be. <br>
 <br>
I don’t think <br>
there could be a worse reason <br>
to pursue <br>
an acting career than that. <br>
The plan obviously went south <br>
Super-fast <br>
because the real world <br>
revealed to me <br>
how little talent <br>
I actually had <br>
in this department. <br>
I applied to four graduate schools<br>
and I got into none of them.<br>
 <br>
So I didn’t give up. I moved to Chicago <br>
to do community theater <br>
with a bunch of my Vassar pals. <br>
My biggest role in Chicago<br>
was a walk-on part <br>
in Charles Bush’s <br>
<em>Psycho Beach Party</em>. <br>
 <br>
To support myself <br>
as a non-income-earning actor, <br>
I sold cable TV<br>
door-to-door. <br>
Here <br>
was my pitch:<br>
 <br>
 Knock knock: <br>
“Hello. <br>
My name is Jason Blum <br>
and I’m from Prime cable of Chicago. <br>
Do you have cable TV? <br>
No? <br>
Well, <br>
let me tell you about myself <br>
and our current offer. <br>
I collect payment <br>
for 60 days of cable right now. <br>
Installation is free. <br>
And as long as you cancel <br>
within 60 days <br>
you can get a full refund. <br>
I’ll even call you in 59 days <br>
to remind you to cancel.”<br>
 <br>
And if that pitch didn’t work, <br>
I would get personal:<br>
 <br>
“Think of it this way: <br>
I’m an actor. <br>
I’m in this amazing production <br>
of <em>Psycho Beach Party</em> <br>
down the street. <br>
Come see it! <br>
The worst-case scenario <br>
for this whole transaction <br>
is that you get cable TV <br>
for free for two months<br>
And I <br>
get my commission <br>
so you support the arts <br>
by supporting me.”<br>
 <br>
From selling cable, <br>
I learned the value <br>
of making deals <br>
where both parties win <br>
and also that business is about <br>
a lot more <br>
than money. <br>
But most of all, <br>
it taught me <br>
the value<br>
of telling <br>
the truth.<br>
 <br>
People think <br>
that in order to succeed, <br>
you need to fudge the truth <br>
or pretend you’re something you aren’t. <br>
People think to hustle <br>
means to lie. <br>
That’s not hustling; <br>
it’s lying.<br>
No one gets anywhere<br>
Lying to the world<br>
…or<br>
more importantly<br>
lying to themselves<br>
That’s the wrong path <br>
to take. <br>
I was a broke actor <br>
selling cable TV <br>
door to door <br>
to support myself. <br>
That’s what I told people,<br>
And they believed me, <br>
I sold a LOT <br>
of cable TV…</p>
<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #2 – <br>
The Importance of Friendship</strong></p>

<p>If you happen <br>
to find yourself <br>
being chased down the street <br>
by a machete-wielding killer <br>
who just escaped <br>
from a mental institution, <br>
you should always <br>
have friends <br>
by your side. <br>
The same <br>
is true <br>
in life.<br>
 <br>
In my mid-twenties,<br>
I had a falling out <br>
with a friend <br>
and that led to the loss <br>
of an entire group of friends. <br>
Quickly, <br>
I kind of found myself <br>
alone <br>
in New York City. <br>
It was then <br>
that a friend of mine from Vassar named Alexia Landau, <br>
started dating <br>
a playwright <br>
named Jonathan Marc Sherman. <br>
Jonathan welcomed me <br>
into his group of friends—<br>
mostly <br>
young <br>
working <br>
actors. <br>
Most of them <br>
Had not gone to college. <br>
They had very different lives <br>
from me and my Vassar friends. <br>
And they were all talented <br>
and passionate about their craft <br>
and I was inspired by them and they were awesome.<br>
My takeaway for you—<br>
Find the people<br>
you would want to be stuck<br>
with in a<br>
cabin in the woods.</p>
<p>At age 25, <br>
I opened myself up <br>
to an entirely new <br>
social world. <br>
I decided to start <br>
a business with them—<br>
a theater company. <br>
It was called <br>
Malaparte. <br>
It was also<br>
at that time,<br>
that I met an actor named<br>
Ethan Hawke. <br>
Ethan and I <br>
have collaborated on a half-dozen projects. <br>
We are so close <br>
that he has been willing to die for me twice.<br>
 <br>
The experience at Malaparte <br>
helped teach me how to produce <br>
and how to work with <br>
and relate to <br>
artists. <br>
 <br>
Treasure the friendships <br>
you have made. <br>
But also <br>
be open to meeting new <br>
and different people <br>
with different backgrounds <br>
or educations than yours. The friends you have now—<br>
and the ones you’re about to make <br>
in the next five years—<br>
will shape your life <br>
more <br>
than you can imagine. <br>
</p>

<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #3 - <br>
Sometimes Jump-scares <br>
are Just <br>
Jump-scares</strong></p>
<p>You know that character <br>
who walks through a haunted house <br>
and hears something spooky? <br>
They’re convinced <br>
they’re about to be killed. <br>
So they scream. <br>
But that sound? <br>
It’s never the killer. <br>
It’s a rattling window <br>
or a loud dishwasher <br>
or their dog barking. <br>
That’s called <br>
a JUMP SCARE. <br>
Because it makes the audience<br>
and the character <br>
JUMP. <br>
The meaningless bang <br>
is what distracts the character, <br>
and the audience, <br>
from the real killer. <br>
And the same thing happens <br>
in life. <br>
 <br>
You have all been given <br>
a highly valuable <br>
blue-chip education. <br>
You will put so much pressure on yourselves <br>
to quickly turn that education <br>
into something really significant <br>
and IMPORTANT. <br>
You will stress and be scared<br>
about that first step in your career <br>
because you will be thinking <br>
about the step after that, <br>
and after that. <br>
You will be <br>
tip toeing through that haunted house…<br>
 <br>
Well, don’t do that! <br>
When I graduated from Vassar, <br>
I was scared about “my career” <br>
ALL <br>
THE <br>
TIME. <br>
I was scared about <br>
what city to live in. <br>
I was scared about <br>
what job to take. <br>
I was scared about <br>
asking my parents for money. <br>
I was scared about <br>
not asking my parents for money. <br>
I was scared about <br>
which friends were doing what. <br>
I was just scared. <br>
 <br>
When I finally <br>
got my foot in the door <br>
in the movie business, <br>
I was scared about <br>
making movies <br>
that MATTERED– <br>
that had a cultural impact, <br>
that would change <br>
the way people saw the world, <br>
that would win Oscars. <br>
But guess what? <br>
The movies I ended up making? <br>
Nobody saw them.<br>
 <br>
Never heard of one of them, right?<br>
I told you.<br>
 <br>
Frustrated by the fact <br>
that nobody saw <br>
the movies I worked on, <br>
in my mid-30s, <br>
my dream finally came true. <br>
I finally <br>
got to make <br>
that big budget <br>
Hollywood movie.  <br>
It was called <br>
 <br>
<em>THE TOOTH FAIRY</em>.</p>
<p>And guess what?<br>
 <br>
My dream <br>
turned out to be <br>
a nightmare. <br>
I had 40 meetings literally<br>
about The Rock’s <br>
tooth fairy costume. <br>
And then <br>
on the weekend before we started shooting, <br>
the head of the studio, <br>
who had never seen the costume, <br>
saw the costume. <br>
He hated it. <br>
He thought the movie would fail <br>
if Dwayne Johnson’s fairy costume <br>
didn’t look good. <br>
I told him <br>
that everyone beneath him <br>
had approved it <br>
and loved it…<br>
including the director <br>
and The Rock! <br>
He didn’t care. <br>
So I spent all weekend<br>
 helping the wardrobe department <br>
make adjustments <br>
and sending video tapes <br>
of these adjustments <br>
back to the head <br>
of the studio. <br>
What was the result? <br>
Ta-Da!<br>
 <br>
So, sure, <br>
people finally saw <br>
something I worked on.  <br>
The movie was a success.  <br>
But the process of making it <br>
was soul-crushing <br>
and I considered quitting the movie business<br>
altogether.<br>
 <br>
While I was making <br>
<em>The Tooth Fairy</em>, <br>
I happened to see a DVD <br>
of a horror film– <br>
shot for $15,000– <br>
that had been rejected <br>
from every studio <br>
in Hollywood. <br>
The movie had no future. <br>
But I saw something special in it <br>
and my feeling was confirmed <br>
when I showed it to other people <br>
and it scared them to death. <br>
So I spent the next three years <br>
trying to convince various corporate entities, <br>
marketing executives, <br>
and distribution gurus <br>
that I was right. <br>
Nobody believed me. <br>
And that movie <br>
was <em>Paranormal Activity</em>. <br>
<em>Paranormal Activity</em> went on to become <br>
the most profitable film of all time. <br>
 <br>
And I realized, <br>
totally by accident, <br>
that you could make a scary movie <br>
with complete creative freedom <br>
on a low budget <br>
and it could come out in a bigger way <br>
than <em>The Tooth Fairy</em>. <br>
In other words, <br>
the process of making it <br>
could be fun, <br>
and the movie itself <br>
could have a real impact. <br>
 <br>
Paranormal didn’t happen<br>
because I had a bunch of prior successes <br>
that built towards that big success. <br>
It happened because <br>
I had a bunch of prior FAILURES. <br>
My whole company <br>
grew out of those failures. <br>
And because of those failures <br>
I was able to recognize <br>
when a process <br>
and a product <br>
was actually <br>
successful. <br>
I combined my missteps <br>
in independent and studio production <br>
into a new way <br>
of making films. <br>
This was an idea<br>
 that I built our company on: <br>
by lowering the budgets, <br>
we give filmmakers total creative freedom <br>
and have studios <br>
release our films. <br>
That idea, <br>
which sprung from failure, <br>
led to movies like <em>Get Out</em>. <br>
 <br>
That same <br>
“screw it let me try something” attitude <br>
that I’d gotten <br>
thanks to my frustrations <br>
with <em>The Tooth Fairy</em><br>
would’ve been really useful to me <br>
when I graduated <br>
from Vassar. <br>
I wish someone had shaken me hard <br>
and told me not to worry and be so scared all the time. <br>
I wish they had told me <br>
<em>not to jump <br>
at the jump scares</em>. <br>
If I had had that attitude, <br>
I might’ve had more jobs, <br>
where I failed, <br>
more jobs <br>
where I was frustrated, <br>
more jobs<br>
 that would’ve led me <br>
to my ultimate passion <br>
MUCH, MUCH<br>
sooner <br>
in life.<br>
 </p>

<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #4 - <br>
Don’t Celebrate Too Early</strong></p>
<p>
In a horror movie,<br>
 the person who escapes the killer <br>
in minute 47 <br>
and celebrates in minute 48, <br>
typically dies <br>
around minute 49. <br>
The same is true <br>
in life. <br>
 <br>
After the release <br>
of <em>Paranormal Activity</em>, <br>
I thought to myself, <br>
well, <br>
great, <br>
the struggle <br>
is finally over. <br>
I have produced <br>
the most profitable movie <br>
in the history <br>
of the movie business. <br>
No more uphill battles.<br>
Then, <br>
Eight months later <br>
the studio that released <em>Paranormal Activity</em><br>
fired me. <br>
 <br>
If there was anything <br>
as important to building my company <br>
as the release of <em>Paranormal Activity</em>, <br>
it was getting fired <br>
from Paramount. <br>
 That <br>
gave me the drive I needed to say, <br>
“You know what? <br>
I don’t need you, Paramount. <br>
I can do this on my own.” <br>
And that’s<br>
what I did.<br>
 <br>
And staying with it <br>
opened up doors<br>
 that I never thought <br>
were possible.  <br>
Ironically,<br>
I have Paramount to thank <br>
for forcing me <br>
to pursue my dream<br>
of running my own company.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, PARAMOUNT.</p>
 <br>
 <br>

<p><strong>Lesson #5 - <br>
Speak Your Mind</strong></p>
<p.If you think <br>
You know who the bad guy is, <br>
say it! <br>
You just may be right <br>
and it may save YOUR LIFE<br>
 <br>
On election night<br>
in 2018, <br>
I spoke at the Israeli Film Festival <br>
in Los Angeles <br>
and three minutes into the speech, <br>
the audience <br>
began to boo and hiss at me <br>
for saying something political <br>
at a film festival. <br>
As the volume rose, <br>
a voice deep inside me, <br>
informed by my education at Vassar <br>
as well as by the fortitude <br>
instilled in me <br>
by my mom and dad, <br>
told me to stand my ground, <br>
Even<br>
 as I was physically removed <br>
from the stage. <br>
 <br>
With well over half the audience <br>
applauding the use of force <br>
to get me off that stage, <br>
it wasn’t easy to stay calm, <br>
but I finished my speech <br>
with dignity and conviction. <br>
You can see this whole event <br>
on you tube! <br>
Just google <br>
Jason Blum,<br>
the Great Satan. <br>
 <br>
That night, <br>
notes of congratulation and support <br>
poured in. <br>
I actually<br>
printed out all the emails I received <br>
and you can find them <br>
on a coffee table <br>
in our reception area <br>
at Blumhouse. <br>
Those emails <br>
were better <br>
than any of the Oscars or Emmys <br>
that Hollywood gives out.<br>
 <br>

<p><strong>Final Scary Movie Lesson - <br>
Capitalize on Luck</strong></p>
 <br>
So in a horror movie if a genetically-mutated animal <br>
happens to get hit by a bus <br>
right before trying to eat you for dinner, <br>
take advantage of that luck! <br>
The same is true <br>
in real life.<br>
 <br>
You have to be lucky, <br>
and I have been so so lucky.<br>
But you can’t get lucky <br>
without trying again and again. <br>
The more chances you take, <br>
the more times luck <br>
has to work<br>
 its magic.  <br>
 <br>
I have been lucky <br>
in so many ways and I’m so grateful for that.<br>
But I think <br>
my luck has run deepest <br>
in the people who have guided me <br>
along the way. <br>
I was lucky to have parents <br>
who showed me that art matters <br>
and has the power <br>
to change the world. <br>
I was lucky to have a grandmother <br>
who taught me the importance <br>
of grit. <br>
I was lucky to have an aunt <br>
who showed me unconditional love. <br>
And I was lucky enough to have a philosophy teacher <br>
here at Vassar <br>
named Michael McCarthy, <br>
who taught me <br>
how to see joy in the world.<br>
 He is still on the faculty here <br>
and probably watching this <br>
with all of you. </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>To sum it all up: <br>
when I graduated, <br>
I felt overwhelmed <br>
by the fact that my future <br>
was just <br>
one <br>
vast <br>
expanse. <br>
For every year of your life <br>
until you graduate <br>
you know <br>
to a certain degree <br>
what will come next. <br>
That is over now. <br>
The future <br>
has just become <br>
that vast <br>
expanse. <br>
That’s why today <br>
is such an important day. <br>
You can get scared, you can get<br>
intimidated, <br>
and daunted, <br>
or <br>
you can look at it <br>
as the next <br>
great <br>
adventure. <br>
Opportunities will be there for you, I promise<br>
 but they will not always be appealing. <br>
For others, <br>
you may also have to chase them down. <br>
Some will be off the beaten track, <br>
out-of-the-box, <br>
off-the-rails, <br>
but don’t judge. <br>
People passed judgement on me <br>
and they still do, <br>
for producing horror movies. <br>
If I had been threatened <br>
by that judgement, <br>
I wouldn’t be <br>
where I am today. <br>
 <br>
Stay open to people <br>
and travel down paths <br>
that may not necessarily feel <br>
as if they are leading <br>
to the next big thing.<br>
 And remember—<br>
if you can survive a scary movie, <br>
you can thrive in life.<br>
 <br>
I am sure <br>
that when you entered Vassar <br>
you had plans <br>
for post-graduation <br>
that did not involve <br>
a global <br>
pandemic. <br>
That must hurt. <br>
It must hurt a lot. <br>
And it must feel unfair. <br>
Because it is. <br>
I would be pissed. <br>
But embrace those feelings. <br>
Don’t do what I did <br>
when I graduated <br>
and let the future <br>
scare and intimidate you. <br>
Embrace it <br>
and hold it close. <br>
It is your new friend. <br>
 <br>
Use those feelings <br>
to do things <br>
that make you squirm, <br>
cringe <br>
and struggle. <br>
Use them to explore new ideas. <br>
To discover what really moves you.<br>
 <br>
Yes, <br>
you’ll need help <br>
from friends along the way. <br>
You’ll need to stay sharp, <br>
even when you find success. <br>
And <br>
you’ll need to capitalize <br>
on lucky moments <br>
when you find them. <br>
 <br>
Don’t jump at the jump-scares. <br>
Don’t let moments <br>
of failure and frustration <br>
distract you. <br>
Let them empower you <br>
and make you stronger. <br>
Pandemics, <br>
like all crisis <br>
are the mothers of invention.<br>
 <br>
So go invent. <br>
 <br>
You may not achieve <br>
the goals you have set for yourself now. <br>
You will achieve even more.<br>
<br>
Thank you <br>
and congratulations.<br>
