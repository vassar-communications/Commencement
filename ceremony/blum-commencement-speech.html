<h3 style="text-align: center">Commencement Transcript</h3>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Jason Blum is a three-time Academy Award nominee, two-time Emmy Award-winning producer and Vassar trustee and Commencement Speaker.</em></p>

<p>Hello Graduates.
Parents.
Faculty.
Trustees,
President Bradley,
Family
and Friends.</p>

<p>I’m sorry
you guys will never be able
to experience
a real life
in person
graduation.
But
take it from me.
Unless you really
hated
college
and couldn’t wait
a second more
to get out,
graduation day
is
terrible.
It’s you
with your divorced parents
having to be together.
It’s trying
very hard
not to act hung over
with your grandparents.
It’s sweaty.
Its sad.
And it usually ends
driving
all your belongings
in a U-Haul
into the abyss.</p>

<p>But I get
it is a huge
bummer
that you missed
the better part
of your senior spring semester.
I really
get it—that sucks.
In fact,
I made my first movie
about that.
It was written
and directed
by my Vassar roommate,
Noah Baumbach
and it was called,
at least for a while,
<em>Fifth Year</em>—eventually it was called <em>Kicking and Screaming</em>—anyway
it was about
four guys
who love college
so much
they make up reasons
to stay
an extra year.</p>

<p>So I get it.
But don’t fret too much
about missing
this in-person ceremony.</p>

<p>Anyway, who the hell am I?
I’m Jason Blum.
I graduated from Vassar in 1991. Yes!
I run a company in Hollywood
called Blumhouse.
We make all kinds of movies,
TV shows, and documentaries.
 We did <em>Whiplash</em>
and <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>,<br />
we have a doc we just released called <em>Secret Love</em> on Netflix.</p>

<p>But the company
was built on
and is still known for
scary movies.
Movies like <em>The Purge</em>,
<em>Paranormal Activity</em>,
<em>Get Out</em> and <em>The Invisible Man</em></p>

<p>And I am here
for
a very simple reason.
The world out there
 looks very much
like one of my horror movies,
so who better
to help you navigate it?
Today,
I am going to share with you
the lessons you need
to survive and thrive
in a horror movie,
or in this case,
—the real world.</p>
        
<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #1 -
Be true to who you are</strong></p>

<p>From a young age
I was blessed
and cursed
with being extremely
competitive.
Cursed,
because I was not very good
at schoolwork.
I had street smarts
but my book smarts
(and grades)
were just OK.
This left me full of anxiety.
Immediately after I graduated,
I was in a terrible rush to succeed.
Remember
this was before the age
of the Internet entrepreneur.
When I graduated,
Mark Zuckerberg
was seven years old.
When I
was 20,
the only other people
who were my age
and really successful
    were famous actors.</p>

<p>So that’s what I wanted to be.
</p>
<p>I don’t think
there could be a worse reason
to pursue
an acting career than that.
The plan obviously went south
Super-fast
because the real world
revealed to me
how little talent
I actually had
in this department.
I applied to four graduate schools
and I got into none of them.</p>

<p>So I didn’t give up. I moved to Chicago
to do community theater
with a bunch of my Vassar pals.
My biggest role in Chicago
was a walk-on part
in Charles Bush’s
<em>Psycho Beach Party</em>.</p>

<p>To support myself
as a non-income-earning actor,
I sold cable TV
door-to-door.
Here
was my pitch:</p>

<p> Knock knock:
“Hello.
My name is Jason Blum
and I’m from Prime cable of Chicago.
Do you have cable TV?
No?
Well,
let me tell you about myself
and our current offer.
I collect payment
for 60 days of cable right now.
Installation is free.
And as long as you cancel
within 60 days
you can get a full refund.
I’ll even call you in 59 days
to remind you to cancel.”</p>

<p>And if that pitch didn’t work,
I would get personal:</p>

<p>“Think of it this way:
I’m an actor.
I’m in this amazing production
of <em>Psycho Beach Party</em>
down the street.
Come see it!
The worst-case scenario
for this whole transaction
is that you get cable TV
for free for two months
And I
get my commission
so you support the arts
by supporting me.”</p>

<p>From selling cable,
I learned the value
of making deals
where both parties win
and also that business is about
a lot more
than money.
But most of all,
it taught me
the value
of telling
the truth.</p>

<p>People think
that in order to succeed,
you need to fudge the truth
or pretend you’re something you aren’t.
People think to hustle
means to lie.
That’s not hustling;
it’s lying.
No one gets anywhere
Lying to the world
…or
more importantly
lying to themselves
That’s the wrong path
to take.
I was a broke actor
selling cable TV
door to door
to support myself.
That’s what I told people,
And they believed me,
I sold a LOT
of cable TV…</p>
<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #2 –
The Importance of Friendship</strong></p>

<p>If you happen
to find yourself
being chased down the street
by a machete-wielding killer
who just escaped
from a mental institution,
you should always
have friends
by your side.
The same
is true
    in life.</p>
<p>In my mid-twenties,
I had a falling out
with a friend
and that led to the loss
of an entire group of friends.
Quickly,
I kind of found myself
alone
in New York City.
It was then
that a friend of mine from Vassar named Alexia Landau,
started dating
a playwright
named Jonathan Marc Sherman.
Jonathan welcomed me
into his group of friends—
mostly
young
working
actors.
Most of them
Had not gone to college.
They had very different lives
from me and my Vassar friends.
And they were all talented
and passionate about their craft
and I was inspired by them and they were awesome.
My takeaway for you—
Find the people
you would want to be stuck
with in a
cabin in the woods.</p>
<p>At age 25,
I opened myself up
to an entirely new
social world.
I decided to start
a business with them—a theater company.
It was called
Malaparte.
It was also
at that time,
that I met an actor named
Ethan Hawke.
Ethan and I
have collaborated on a half-dozen projects.
We are so close
that he has been willing to die for me twice.</p>

<p>The experience at Malaparte
helped teach me how to produce
and how to work with
and relate to
artists.</p>

<p>Treasure the friendships
you have made.
But also
be open to meeting new
and different people
with different backgrounds
or educations than yours. The friends you have now—and the ones you’re about to make
in the next five years—will shape your life
more
than you can imagine.
</p>

<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #3 -
Sometimes Jump-scares
are Just
Jump-scares</strong></p>
<p>You know that character
who walks through a haunted house
and hears something spooky?
They’re convinced
they’re about to be killed.
So they scream.
But that sound?
It’s never the killer.
It’s a rattling window
or a loud dishwasher
or their dog barking.
That’s called
a JUMP SCARE.
Because it makes the audience
and the character
JUMP.
The meaningless bang
is what distracts the character,
and the audience,
from the real killer.
And the same thing happens
in life.</p>

<p>You have all been given
a highly valuable
blue-chip education.
You will put so much pressure on yourselves
to quickly turn that education
into something really significant
and IMPORTANT.
You will stress and be scared
about that first step in your career
because you will be thinking
about the step after that,
and after that.
You will be
tip toeing through that haunted house…</p>

<p>Well, don’t do that!
When I graduated from Vassar,
I was scared about “my career”
ALL
THE
TIME.
I was scared about
what city to live in.
I was scared about
what job to take.
I was scared about
asking my parents for money.
I was scared about
not asking my parents for money.
I was scared about
which friends were doing what.
I was just scared.</p>

<p>When I finally
got my foot in the door
in the movie business,
I was scared about
making movies
that MATTERED–
that had a cultural impact,
that would change
the way people saw the world,
that would win Oscars.
But guess what?
The movies I ended up making?
Nobody saw them.</p>

<p>Never heard of one of them, right?
I told you.</p>

<p>Frustrated by the fact
that nobody saw
the movies I worked on,
in my mid-30s,
my dream finally came true.
I finally
got to make
that big budget
Hollywood movie. 
It was called
<em>THE TOOTH FAIRY</em>.</p>
<p>And guess what?
My dream
turned out to be
a nightmare.
I had 40 meetings literally
about The Rock’s
tooth fairy costume.
And then
on the weekend before we started shooting,
the head of the studio,
who had never seen the costume,
saw the costume.
He hated it.
He thought the movie would fail
if Dwayne Johnson’s fairy costume
didn’t look good.
I told him
that everyone beneath him
had approved it
and loved it…
including the director
and The Rock!
He didn’t care.
So I spent all weekend
 helping the wardrobe department
make adjustments
and sending video tapes
of these adjustments
back to the head
of the studio.
What was the result?
    Ta-Da!</p>

<p>So, sure,
people finally saw
something I worked on. 
The movie was a success. 
But the process of making it
was soul-crushing
and I considered quitting the movie business
altogether.</p>

<p>While I was making
<em>The Tooth Fairy</em>,
I happened to see a DVD
of a horror film–
shot for $15,000–
that had been rejected
from every studio
in Hollywood.
The movie had no future.
But I saw something special in it
and my feeling was confirmed
when I showed it to other people
and it scared them to death.
So I spent the next three years
trying to convince various corporate entities,
marketing executives,
and distribution gurus
that I was right.
Nobody believed me.
And that movie
was <em>Paranormal Activity</em>.
<em>Paranormal Activity</em> went on to become
the most profitable film of all time.</p>

<p>And I realized,
totally by accident,
that you could make a scary movie
with complete creative freedom
on a low budget
and it could come out in a bigger way
than <em>The Tooth Fairy</em>.
In other words,
the process of making it
could be fun,
and the movie itself
could have a real impact.</p>

<p>Paranormal didn’t happen
because I had a bunch of prior successes
that built towards that big success.
It happened because
I had a bunch of prior FAILURES.
My whole company
grew out of those failures.
And because of those failures
I was able to recognize
when a process
and a product
was actually
successful.
I combined my missteps
in independent and studio production
into a new way
of making films.
This was an idea
 that I built our company on:
by lowering the budgets,
we give filmmakers total creative freedom
and have studios
release our films.
That idea,
which sprung from failure,
led to movies like <em>Get Out</em>.</p>

<p>That same
“screw it let me try something” attitude
that I’d gotten
thanks to my frustrations
with <em>The Tooth Fairy</em>
would’ve been really useful to me
when I graduated
from Vassar.
I wish someone had shaken me hard
and told me not to worry and be so scared all the time.
I wish they had told me
<em>not to jump
at the jump scares</em>.
If I had had that attitude,
I might’ve had more jobs,
where I failed,
more jobs
where I was frustrated,
more jobs
 that would’ve led me
to my ultimate passion
MUCH, MUCH
sooner
in life.
 </p>

<p><strong>Scary Movie Lesson #4 -
Don’t Celebrate Too Early</strong></p>
<p>
<p>In a horror movie,
 the person who escapes the killer
in minute 47
and celebrates in minute 48,
typically dies
around minute 49.
The same is true
in life.</p>

<p>After the release
of <em>Paranormal Activity</em>,
I thought to myself,
well,
great,
the struggle
is finally over.
I have produced
the most profitable movie
in the history
of the movie business.
No more uphill battles.
Then,
Eight months later
the studio that released <em>Paranormal Activity</em>
fired me.</p>

<p>If there was anything
as important to building my company
as the release of <em>Paranormal Activity</em>,
it was getting fired
from Paramount.
 That
gave me the drive I needed to say,
“You know what?
I don’t need you, Paramount.
I can do this on my own.”
And that’s
what I did.</p>

<p>And staying with it
opened up doors
 that I never thought
were possible. 
Ironically,
I have Paramount to thank
for forcing me
to pursue my dream
of running my own company.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, PARAMOUNT.</p>



<p><strong>Lesson #5 -
Speak Your Mind</strong></p>
<p>If you think
You know who the bad guy is,
say it!
You just may be right
and it may save YOUR LIFE</p>

<p>On election night
in 2018,
I spoke at the Israeli Film Festival
in Los Angeles
and three minutes into the speech,
the audience
began to boo and hiss at me
for saying something political
at a film festival.
As the volume rose,
a voice deep inside me,
informed by my education at Vassar
as well as by the fortitude
instilled in me
by my mom and dad,
told me to stand my ground,
Even
 as I was physically removed
from the stage.</p>

<p>With well over half the audience
applauding the use of force
to get me off that stage,
it wasn’t easy to stay calm,
but I finished my speech
with dignity and conviction.
You can see this whole event
on you tube!
Just google
Jason Blum,
the Great Satan.</p>

<p>That night,
notes of congratulation and support
poured in.
I actually
printed out all the emails I received
and you can find them
on a coffee table
in our reception area
at Blumhouse.
Those emails
were better
than any of the Oscars or Emmys
that Hollywood gives out.</p>


<p><strong>Final Scary Movie Lesson -
Capitalize on Luck</strong></p>

<p>So in a horror movie if a genetically-mutated animal
happens to get hit by a bus
right before trying to eat you for dinner,
take advantage of that luck!
The same is true
in real life.</p>

<p>You have to be lucky,
and I have been so so lucky.
But you can’t get lucky
without trying again and again.
The more chances you take,
the more times luck
has to work
 its magic. </p>

<p>I have been lucky
in so many ways and I’m so grateful for that.
But I think
my luck has run deepest
in the people who have guided me
along the way.
I was lucky to have parents
who showed me that art matters
and has the power
to change the world.
I was lucky to have a grandmother
who taught me the importance
of grit.
I was lucky to have an aunt
who showed me unconditional love.
And I was lucky enough to have a philosophy teacher
here at Vassar
named Michael McCarthy,
who taught me
how to see joy in the world.
 He is still on the faculty here
and probably watching this
with all of you. </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>To sum it all up:
when I graduated,
I felt overwhelmed
by the fact that my future
was just
one
vast
expanse.
For every year of your life
until you graduate
you know
to a certain degree
what will come next.
That is over now.
The future
has just become
that vast
expanse.
That’s why today
is such an important day.
You can get scared, you can get
intimidated,
and daunted,
or
you can look at it
as the next
great
adventure.
Opportunities will be there for you, I promise
 but they will not always be appealing.
For others,
you may also have to chase them down.
Some will be off the beaten track,
out-of-the-box,
off-the-rails,
but don’t judge.
People passed judgement on me
and they still do,
for producing horror movies.
If I had been threatened
by that judgement,
I wouldn’t be
where I am today.</p>

<p>Stay open to people
and travel down paths
that may not necessarily feel
as if they are leading
to the next big thing.
 And remember—if you can survive a scary movie,
you can thrive in life.</p>

<p>I am sure
that when you entered Vassar
you had plans
for post-graduation
that did not involve
a global
pandemic.
That must hurt.
It must hurt a lot.
And it must feel unfair.
Because it is.
I would be pissed.
But embrace those feelings.
Don’t do what I did
when I graduated
and let the future
scare and intimidate you.
Embrace it
and hold it close.
It is your new friend.</p>

<p>Use those feelings
to do things
that make you squirm,
cringe
and struggle.
Use them to explore new ideas.
To discover what really moves you.</p>

<p>Yes,
you’ll need help
from friends along the way.
You’ll need to stay sharp,
even when you find success.
And
you’ll need to capitalize
on lucky moments
when you find them.</p>

<p>Don’t jump at the jump-scares.
Don’t let moments
of failure and frustration
distract you.
Let them empower you
and make you stronger.
Pandemics,
like all crisis
are the mothers of invention.</p>

<p>So go invent.</p>

<p>You may not achieve
the goals you have set for yourself now.
You will achieve even more.</p>

<p>Thank you
and congratulations.
