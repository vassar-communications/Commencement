	As far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be a function to get a key-value pair from a map based on index number. This might be clumsy, but it works: iterate across the map, incrementing a counter, until the counter matches the specified index, at which point you return the value.

          which means we're past the base styling and should be wrapping any
          additional values in media queries. However, we're also using $i
          to determine which breakpoint we should use.
          
          If we grabbed the $ith value in the breakpoints map, we'd have already
          skipped past the first breakpoint. If our breakpoints are small,
          medium, and large, the resulting CSS would have styling for base
          values (no media query), and then CSS wrapped in a media query for
          the medium breakpoint. But what happened to the small breakpoint?
          
          So we have to cheat a little. We're still using $i to determine which
          value in a series of styles we should use, but when we use $i to refer to
          a breakpoint, we decrement it. So say $i is 2. We're grabbing the second
          value in the list of, say, font-sizes. However, we need an additional
          variable - something set to $i-1 - to get the appropriate breakpoint,
          which should be "small". Let's call that $j.

          (I think the best way to do this would be to start with 0 instead of 1;
          but Sass doesn't allow referring to the 0th element of a list of
          values.)
